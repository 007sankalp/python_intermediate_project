## Reshape the above-created zeros_array to dimensions (2,3,4)

Great,now that you have learnt how to create numpy arrays, let's start experimenting by saving the value in a variable named zeros_array_reshaped

You need to write a function `array_reshaped_zeros()` that performs the operation of reshaping the variable zeros_array_reshaped to dimensions (2,3,4).

## Parameters:
This function takes in no parameters

## Returns
This function returns an array of dimensions (2,3,4)
