## Task 7:Find the set of all unique teams that played in the matches in the data set.

Create a function that answers this question.

**The function should**
- Be named `get_unique_teams_set`
- Work on the previously created `ipl_matches_array` object
- Should return a SET of all unique teams

Last exercise we learned about the unique values and how to extract it , this exercise is further implementation and experimentation
of unique values. This exercise will help you learn about unique values and its application over data set.
